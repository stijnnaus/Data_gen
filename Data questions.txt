Questions regarding data:

- Can I combine NOAA and AGAGE data? 

- Why the weird latitudinal band weights in Montzka (2011)


Montzka (2011):

- 9 stations (3 SH, 6 NH): 
	- SH: South Pole (SPO, high), Cape Grim (CGO, mid), Cape Matatula (SMO, low)
	- NH: 	Low: Cape Kumukahi (KUM), Mauna Loa (MLO)
		Mid: Niwot Ridge (NWR), Wisonsin (LEF)
		High: Barrow (BRW), Alert (ALT)
- 6 boxes: 3 latitudinal bands per hemisphere. He took 1 station per band in the SH and 2 per band in NH. 
- Weight per band: [0.97, 0.76, 0.40]:[low, mid, high] (but changing this had no strong effect)

Schaefer (2016)

- 17 measurement stations (10 NH, 7 SH) (See table S2 of supplements)
1. Monthly values were averaged for each year (missing months filled by interpolation from adjacent years)
2. They calculated yearly averages for 5 latitudinal bands 
   (90-60N (2), 60-30N (5), 30N-30S (4), 30-60S (2), 60-90S (3))
3. The area-weighted average of each latitudinal band was taken as the global mean
4. They calculated a spline fit through historical data
1700 - 1987: They use the historical spline
1988 - 1996: They splice the station data with the historical spline
1996 - 2014: Only the station data is included


Schwietzke (2016)

- Very many stations
